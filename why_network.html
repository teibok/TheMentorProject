<p><h2>The Mentor Project</h2>We strongly believe that self-driven, ambitious, and hardworking individuals will not only  achieve their goals much faster, but also will develop their potential much more, learn faster and, not only escape many wrong decisions in their path (and their possible consequences) but learn to make better ones,<br/> if only such individuals had a mentor or a similar group to  guide them, coach them, and give them their insights.<br/>
We learn faster when we learn together.<br/>
Our mission is to connect these people together, bring together a group of people to learn together or a mentor to the mentee, because together we achieve more

<!--Add a search for mentors or mates in home
But people must first provide details about themselves or link through facebook
Or google so that we can use it to search suitable people for them-->
